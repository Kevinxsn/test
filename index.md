## Overview

Housing prices serve as a key indicator of a region's economic health. The fluctuation of housing prices over time offers insights into the region's development to a certain degree. In this project, you will explore notable trends in housing prices over the past decade, alongside their correlation with changes in environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. An exciting aspect of this project is the opportunity to select the datasets you find most compelling for the topic you chose. You will engage in data manipulation techniques such as concatenation and merging of DataFrames, skills that were introduced at the start of this course!

## Getting The Data
You can get the data from [`here`](). 

The data about housing prices is provided by [`Zillow`](https://www.zillow.com/). The data about the weather is provided by [`United States Census Bureau`](https://www.census.gov/). 


This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
